// Jen designed no about page, so this is built only from devices that already
// exist: the hero's full-bleed black treatment for the opening, the inset
// white SectionPanel for the body, the quote break reused as it stands, and
// the drop promo to give the page somewhere to go. No new type sizes, no new
// colours, no photography — the three columns carry it, which also means
// nothing here is waiting on Jen.
//
// It is our own page rather than a redirect to launchdarkly.com because
// sending a prospect off to the marketing site in the middle of a demo loses
// the thread. The outbound link lives in the middle column instead.

            ToggleWear is the LaunchDarkly swag store — the sweatshirts, hats,
            tech accessories and everyday merch that turn up at conferences, on
            onboarding desks, and in the post when someone does something good.
            It is run by people who spend their days thinking about releases,
            which is why a shop that sells socks has opinions about rollouts.
